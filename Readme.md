# KVS - String
[KVS](http://npmjs.org/package/kvs) or   *K*ey *V*alue *S*tore is an abstract KeyValueStore system. The *kvs-** group of node modules, are intended to present a unified interface to key value stores of every persuasion. This allows for substituting them without changing anything but the initializing parameters.

*KVS-filter* modules are modules that are used to modify the requests to the KVS system. They can transform the *key* or the *value* or both in some way. However they need to take either be transparent and keep to the KVS-system definition (i.e.: values are buffers, etc...) or be used close to the consumer of the API.

*KVS-string* is a *KVS filter* module that accepts strings as values and transforms them into buffers for actual storage. On the reverse it takes the buffer it receives from underlying storage, and stringifies it before returning to the consumer. This means it breaks the KVS conventions and is a utility module that is used to wrap kvs instances.

## Install
    npm install kvs-string
    
## Use
    var KVS=require('kvs-string');
    var store = new KVS(store); // pass in the KVS-Instance that is used as storage
    store.set('name',  'this is a string', function(err) {…});
    store.get('name', function(err, value) {
    	// attention! value will be a string (or null if not found)
    });
    store.remove('name', function(err) { … });
    store.list('name', function(err, value) { … });
